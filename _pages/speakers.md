### Rachel Uwa

[#newsociety — a call out to future humans: let's be bolder](/talks#newsociety--a-call-out-to-future-humans-lets-be-bolder)

Rachel Uwa is an artist, educator, and founder of School of Machines, Making &
Make-Believe.

Over the past 15+ years she’s lived in and organized social justice and tech
communities and events big and small. She feels compelled to help bring these
two worlds together and make the tech world less daunting and more diverse,
inclusive, thoughtful, and fun.

Rachel's biggest desire is to see people living the lives they dream of living
rather than the one they feel they ought to. If that dream life is more
artistic, creative, socially-engaged, technology-embracing and connects humans
to each other and to themselves, well, all the better.
