# EnthusiastiCon Prospectus

EnthusiastiCon is a free two day event in Berlin around enthusiasm for computing.
2019 will be its third edition.
It is one day of short talks at 10 minutes each followed by a second day of participant led workshops.
We aim for diversity in our speakers and their material while aiming for a broad audience too by proactively reaching-out.
We hope to open up conference speaking to people who'd otherwise be hesitant because of background or the material they want to present.
Our only criteria are that the material is about computing and enthusiasm!

## Last Year

- How many attendees

In 2018 were humbled by the quality and refreshing variety of our talks.
What's more is that we were able to make EnthusiastiCon free to attend which we believe is key to making it accessible and inclusive.
We were able to do this because of the support we recieved from sponsors.

Points for last year:

* Last year we had more than double the number of talks proposed than slots.
* 60 attendees on the first day of talks
* 30 attendees on the second day of participant-led workshops
* 00 of our 16 were first time speakers

## Our Team

The 2019 organising team is Veit Heller, Jens Ohlig, Moritz Neeb, Joseph Yiasemides, and Nasreen Abu-Hunaina.
Inspired by !!Con in NYC and its other derivative conferences we liked the idea of holding a similar event in Europe.
One of our organisers wrote a blog post in 2018 with some context surrounding the conference: https://blog.veitheller.de/Enthusiasticon.html
